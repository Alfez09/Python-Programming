For example: the button to accept orders is in the same place as a lot of other buttons and since it comes on so suddenly you can\\'t help but accidentally press it. the map keeps flipping upside down and decentering while navigating. the trip raidar displays multiple requests but they keep reloading and changing places when you open the radar, messages like \"leave at door\" come on every drop-off and cover up the street address. Uugh!',\n",
       "  \"So far, my experience has been better than any other gig app. While getting going for took... 2 years or so... the support via chat was extremely helpful. I wasn't on a waitlist, but I had document issues that took me a while to get going. Now that I am going, I am the most satisfied with this app. I imagine some other apps are good money makers in busier areas, but where I am at, Uber seems to be it for me.\",\n",
       "  'FIX YOUR APP!! The button to start the trip does NOT need to pop up and hide important driving directions when we are more than 1 minute away from the destination!!!!! This is too much intracoastal with my phone instead of paying attention to the road!! Driver \"support\" is worse than comcast \"customer service\". If I didn\\'t make more money with Uber than Lyft, I wouldn\\'t have anything further to do with them ever. Not even as a passenger.',\n",
       "  'Edit: Accounts get hacked often, bypassing my many 2 factor methods. Orders will show incorrect times and order after completion. Very, very odd. For example, on a stacked order, after about 24 hours or more, the first order will show as the second order and vice versa. Incorrect cancellation rate, orders being accepted that you did not accept, and the app calling the customer instead of the support team. Pay is also incorrect often. Takes hours to get transferred to get compensated.',\n",
       "  \"The app is always functioning. At least once a day, the GPS just stops working all together. When this happens, you can't complete trips. Just this morning, I had to restart my phone twice just to get a trip to both start and end. Destination rarely ever brings you closer to your chosen destination. The problems I have on Uber driver are experienced on a Lyft Driver once every 3-4 months.\",\n",
       "  \"Pretty meh. It lets you make a small amount of money, prob around 8-9 dollars an hour. The gold and platinum incentives are mostly lies. They have hidden requirements that make most people ineligible. The app tries to take complete control of your phone, dont give it the permissions it wants. It'll lock you into an order acceptance screen and will block out your navigation, which is really dangerous. This entire job is really dangerous, actually. Idk you make money but at high cost. (Uber Bike)\",\n",
       "  \"Cheaply thrown together app. Can't detect orientation, map is just a course tracker that needs you to drive in order to get location. UI bugs out constantly, no Android Auto. Customer support has been getting better, though. They still need to have better cancellation fees for when you drive like 30 minutes and you get $4 after the rider cancels. Update: They now just listen to customers and ban people for little to no reason. UPDATE: They are worse now.\",\n",
       "  \"GPS is awful. I couldn't find my first rider because it took me to the street behind the building, which was located in a park. I was being told to go in circles, so the client directed me how to find her. She said the driver who brought her there had the same issue. Then I finally was near her destination and Uber silently let me pass it. Very frustrating! I'm so glad for a sweet and understanding client. This was not the first time.\",\n",
       "  \"This would be a decent app if it were set up more like Doordash is. The map automatically closes when it thinks I've arrived, and that is not only annoying but also not always accurate on the address. I could still be a few houses away and so then, I get the joy of trying to get the map back up and running, which is also a time-consuming process while the customer's food is getting cold and I'm distracted while coasting down the road. I like everything to make sense. This doesn't.\",\n",
       "  \"This app works well when it works correctly. But it has one major issue: Sometimes a delivery shows up on the screen and doesn't disappear no matter what you do, locking up the ENTIRE PHONE! The only way to fix this is to restart the entire phone. This can waste a minute or more and I've had to deal with this DURING deliveries on multiple occasions. Please fix this major issue!\",\n",
       "  \"Every time there's an update, things only get worse, they don't get better & it's not fixing anything. For an example with this last update, Now they no longer give you directions by voice You have to stare at the map or miss your turns. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, shutting the phone on and off, & clearing the catches & still nothing works. Like I said the updates only make things worse. It's actually more dangerous for us as drivers because we're supposed to be watching the road.\",\n",
       "  'Uber Eats driver. Since my vehicle is \"too old\" for the rider side. Really the app itself is ok. Wish there was more help in using the app. Some situations you need to check with customer or go to another screen and really not clear if you can or can not. The two biggest issues with the app for me is the notification sound is extremely loud and I can\\'t find a way to lower it. The second and most important is the pay is really bad. Tips are a lottery. They need to bump up the base pay period.',\n",
       "  'Overall, the app is cool; one problem I\\'ve been having lately is that when it prompts me to update it, it just buffers and won\\'t actually update. Another is the in-app GPS. Sometimes it will route WAY out of the way for no reason. When it comes to delivering Walmart orders, it will tell you it\\'s \"1 item\", so you\\'ll accept 3, then when you arrive you\\'ll find that all 3 of those people were actual grocery shopping and have to hope everything fits.',\n",
       "  'Good: \"Opportunities\" screen, rewards, bonus quests. Bad: poor customer service, even as a Platinum driver. Uber still can not refund the wait time fee to the rider, even when the app gave me the wrong address. Buggy navigation; navigation does not take into account distance to the next turn. For example, the app will say \"take any left turning lane\" even if the next turn is immediately afterward. Destination filter does nothing. App decides when you arrive, even if you haven\\'t yet. Bad support',\n",
       "  'App needs a little work. Have lots of great suggestions. Needs a way to flag a route undeliverable in bad weather. Support window needs to be in the chat bubble while navigation is open. Drivers should be able to filter trips out for larger vehicles or allergens. Putting drivers at risk. Please remove the stupid screen that covers the chat box upon delivery. It covers the screen during typing.',\n",
       "  \"App is Buggy. Will pause the app for no reason. Will say go to Test Mode for no reason. I will run the test, and no issue will pop up. Will tell me my battery is low when it's at 70%. Will lose GPS connection in the middle of the ride. Won't end rides on passenger while showing it's already ended on the driver. However, it won't allow drivers to get new passenger requests. Will pop up with a request 10 miles away for a 1 block drive.\",\n",
       "  \"Update since 11/2/22. This UBEREATS app is STILL garbage!! And now there seems to be many more agents in support that do not care about the drivers. And let me not even get started on some of the drivers that STEAL ORDERS!! The trip fares are extremely low in this current high inflation that EVERYONE thru out the US is experiencing so to HELL w/the deliveries w/low pay ($2,$3,$4) w/long distances. This platform among all others, needs to be reminded that w/out drivers, you'd have no platform.\",\n",
       "  'They pay you garbage and you have to rely on tips. Along with that they steadily REMOVE features, like being able to see a price breakdown on an order after its completed. Lastly, the opportunity category never ever has the actual place I deliver, it thinks I was a 1 dollar boost two states away. And guess what, support does absolutely nothing for anything.',\n",
       "  'A fraudulent, poorly functioning app for food delivery couriers. In New York City they do not accurately pay their lawful \"aggregate pay\" under the New York City Delivery Worker protections and wages. Settings for pickup do not work by law. It turns your settings into a distance to dropoff, but will still try to send you 4-7 miles to the restaurant for a dropoff under 3 miles from the pickup. They pay half to as little as 10% of the \"aggregate and bonus pay,\" of other apps, makes no sense.',\n",
       "  \"I do not recommend. Uber pay the minimum for trips, they are very cheap. Most money come from tips . You add many miles in the car, and trips are always long. The support service are not good either. The delivery are not flexible. I mean if you have two pick up or two drop off, you must follow the app gps information .

       "  'description': 'Cyberika is an action-adventure MMORPG with a deep storyline set in a cyberpunk universe. Are you ready to explore a city in the near future called Bradbury Complex?\\r\\n\\r\\nMeet its inhabitants, complete important quests, fight with freaky punks in dark backstreets and race through neon lit streets in your sports car. Who knows, maybe on your way home you’ll stop in downtown to install another body implant or grab some ramen?\\r\\n \\r\\n<b> [ CYBERPUNK RIGHT NOW ] </b>\\r\\nThe city is full of contradictions, the streets overflow with poverty and future technology side-by-side. Money and guns solve most problems here. The police are powerless. Survival of the fittest is the only law. An exciting adventure awaits as you start your journey in a humble apartment on the city’s outskirts. In time you’ll be able to buy fashionable clothes, finest weapons, get the fastest car imaginable and move into a penthouse in the Downtown.\\r\\n \\r\\n<b> [ BE THE BEST. BE UNIQUE ] </b>\\r\\nIn this cyberpunk world there’s no place for weakness. If you lack of speed, strength or hacking skills, just go and get your body improved. It’s what in Bradbury Complex we call Get-The-Augmentation. Upgrade your weapon, skills and body to be the best hired gun in the city. And to make sure you always stand out in the crowd, customize your car, jacket or gun.\\r\\n \\r\\n<b> [ HEART OF THE CITY ] </b>\\r\\nMove to Downtown to be in the center of the action, and the nightlife. Here you’ll always find a huge number of other players, as well as stores, cafes, casinos and nightclubs at your service.\\r\\n \\r\\n<b> [ IMPRESS YOURSELF IN THE STORY ] </b>\\r\\nThe city’s neighborhoods look nothing alike and each is controlled by a different gang. Our immersive storyline will take you to every corner of Bradbury Complex. Ready to drop in on another hacker to make plans for robbing a secret laboratory? What about jacking a rare sports car for a favorite auto mechanic?\\r\\n \\r\\n<b> [ ADVANCED COMBAT SYSTEM ] </b>\\r\\nThere’s a whole arsenal of weapons available to you, from bats and pistols to laser swords and energy rifles. Don’t forget about the cyber implants that can give you superhuman abilities in battle. Find your own tactics to defeat different opponents, from your everyday street punks and cyber-hounds all the way up to military robots, cyber-ninjas and bosses.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b> [ SPEED IS FREEDOM ] </b>\\r\\nYour awesome car is more than a convenient way of getting around the city’s neighborhoods. It has style and soul. You can trust the autopilot with your route, but sometimes it’s better to take the wheel in your hands to get somewhere in time or escape a high-speed chase.\\r\\n\\r\\n<b> [ UPGRADE YOUR HOME ] </b>\\r\\nThere’s a place where you can relax, take a shower, and order your favorite noodles from The Slurp Shop. A place where you can fix up your guns and equipment or install new implants. A place where you’re safe. Your apartment. It might not look like a lot, but it’s functional, and you’ve got an uplink to the net and virtual reality.

       "  'descriptionHTML': 'Cyberika is an action-adventure MMORPG with a deep storyline set in a cyberpunk universe. Are you ready to explore a city in the near future called Bradbury Complex?<br><br>Meet its inhabitants, complete important quests, fight with freaky punks in dark backstreets and race through neon lit streets in your sports car. Who knows, maybe on your way home you’ll stop in downtown to install another body implant or grab some ramen?<br> <br><b> [ CYBERPUNK RIGHT NOW ] </b><br>The city is full of contradictions, the streets overflow with poverty and future technology side-by-side. Money and guns solve most problems here. The police are powerless. Survival of the fittest is the only law. An exciting adventure awaits as you start your journey in a humble apartment on the city’s outskirts. In time you’ll be able to buy fashionable clothes, finest weapons, get the fastest car imaginable and move into a penthouse in the Downtown.<br> <br><b> [ BE THE BEST. BE UNIQUE ] </b><br>In this cyberpunk world there’s no place for weakness. If you lack of speed, strength or hacking skills, just go and get your body improved. It’s what in Bradbury Complex we call Get-The-Augmentation. Upgrade your weapon, skills and body to be the best hired gun in the city. And to make sure you always stand out in the crowd, customize your car, jacket or gun.<br> <br><b> [ HEART OF THE CITY ] </b><br>Move to Downtown to be in the center of the action, and the nightlife. Here you’ll always find a huge number of other players, as well as stores, cafes, casinos and nightclubs at your service.<br> <br><b> [ IMPRESS YOURSELF IN THE STORY ] </b><br>The city’s neighborhoods look nothing alike and each is controlled by a different gang. Our immersive storyline will take you to every corner of Bradbury Complex. Ready to drop in on another hacker to make plans for robbing a secret laboratory? What about jacking a rare sports car for a favorite auto mechanic?<br> <br><b> [ ADVANCED COMBAT SYSTEM ] </b><br>There’s a whole arsenal of weapons available to you, from bats and pistols to laser swords and energy rifles. Don’t forget about the cyber implants that can give you superhuman abilities in battle. Find your own tactics to defeat different opponents, from your everyday street punks and cyber-hounds all the way up to military robots, cyber-ninjas and bosses.<br><br><b> [ SPEED IS FREEDOM ] </b><br>Your awesome car is more than a convenient way of getting around the city’s neighborhoods. It has style and soul. You can trust the autopilot with your route, but sometimes it’s better to take the wheel in your hands to get somewhere in time or escape a high-speed chase.<br><br><b> [ UPGRADE YOUR HOME ] </b><br>There’s a place where you can relax, take a shower, and order your favorite noodles from The Slurp Shop. A place where you can fix up your guns and equipment or install new implants. A place where you’re safe. Your apartment. It might not look like a lot, but it’s functional, and you’ve got an uplink to the net and virtual reality. And, sooner or later, you’re gonna move up in the world, literally.<br><br><b> [ ON WAVES OF SOUND ] </b><br>Every minute, every adventure in Cyberika is accompanied by the leading exponents of retrowave and synthwave, Magic Sword and Power Glove among them.<br> <br><b> [ WANT MORE? ] </b><br>Coming soon are major events in multiplayer mode, including co-op raids and clan wars. You can also get access to cyberspace, the battle for which will be even fiercer.
